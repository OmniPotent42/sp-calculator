# SP Calculator

## Summary

This is a project I made in my free time to assist people who play a Starcraft 2 custom game called Solo Lottery Defense. In the game, you have the option of purchasing many upgrades, and it can get confusing at times. So I created this app, which lets you experiment with which upgrades you want to get.

You can view the app here: https://omnipotent42.github.io/sp-calculator/

## Technologies used:

* Angular2 (with AngularCLI)
